# Component Documentation

This section contains detailed documentation for the reusable components used throughout the Stress Free Events and Weddings website. Each document provides information about the component structure, styling, functionality, and how to make common updates.

## Components

- [Header and Navigation](header-navigation.md)
- [Footer](footer.md)
- [Gallery System](gallery-system.md)
- [Forms](forms.md)
- [Testimonials](testimonials.md)
- [Call-to-Action Sections](cta-sections.md)

## Component Structure

Each component documentation includes:

1. **Overview** - A brief description of the component and its purpose
2. **HTML Structure** - The HTML markup used for the component
3. **CSS Styles** - The key CSS styles that define the component's appearance
4. **JavaScript Functionality** - Any JavaScript code associated with the component
5. **Making Updates** - Instructions for common updates to the component
6. **Responsive Behavior** - How the component behaves on different screen sizes
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and their solutions

## Using Components

Components are reused across multiple pages of the website. When making changes to a component, be aware that the changes will affect all pages that use that component.

### Example: Header Component

The header component appears on every page of the website. If you update the navigation menu in the header, the change will be reflected on all pages.

### Example: Footer Component

The footer component also appears on every page. Updates to the footer content, such as contact information or social media links, will be reflected across the entire site.

## Component Customization

Some components may have page-specific variations. For example:

- The hero section may have different background images on different pages
- The call-to-action section may have different text content on different pages
- The testimonials section may display different testimonials on different pages

These variations are typically controlled through page-specific CSS classes or content changes.
