                <h2>Big Moments in My Coding Journey: January Update</h2>

                <h2>My First Developer Interview</h2>                
                <p>This month, I had the incredible opportunity to interview for a Developer I position at the company I currently work for. 
                    The role is primarily focused on Front-End Development, which aligns perfectly with the skills I’ve been building over the past 15 months. Surprisingly, I wasn’t nervous going into the 
                    interview. Instead, I felt prepared and excited to showcase what I’ve learned. I spent a lot of time reviewing 
                    potential interview questions and brushing up on technical topics, especially in C#, .NET, and front-end concepts.  While I thought the interview went well overall, I got the impression 
                    they’re looking for someone with a bit more experience. Still, this was an invaluable learning experience for me—it showed me how far I’ve come, what I need to focus on, and how to navigate 
                    the job search process moving forward.</p>
                <h2>Launching my YouTube Channel</h2>
                <p>Another major highlight was launching my very own YouTube channel to chronicle my journey as a self-taught developer! I’ve been inspired by watching other coding vlogs, and I felt 
                    like sharing my own story could motivate others while keeping me accountable.  I’ll admit, I was nervous to put my first vlog out there. But after editing the video and sharing it 
                    with close friends and family, their positive feedback gave me the confidence to post it. 
                    The channel is all about the struggles and triumphs of learning to code, and for now, I’m aiming to release a new video every two weeks.   I added a link below to my channel if you want to check it out.</p>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMmnQ_onFGCsTLh-CIw1jg" target="_blank"><button>Check Out My YouTube</button></a>
                <h2>What's Next in my Journey?</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, there are a few key areas I'm focusing on:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.5em;">Keeping up with Vlogging - <br> <p style="font-size: 16px;">I want to continue sharing my journey on YouTube by sticking to my upload schedule and improving the quality of my videos.</p>  </li>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.5em;">Learning and Growing as a Developer - <br> <p style="font-size: 16px;">My focus remains on learning C# and ASP.NET, as these are the critical skills for the types of roles I'm pursuing.</p>  </li>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.5em;">The Job Search Continues - <br> <p style="font-size: 16px;">While I probably won't walk away with the job this time, I see every interview as a step forward.  I'm determined to keep improving,
                        applying for new opportunities, and keep pushing towards my goal of landing a developer role.
                    </p>  </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>This past month has shown me just how far I’ve come since I started learning to code. From stepping into my first developer interview to sharing my story publicly on YouTube, it’s been a month of growth and firsts. 
                    I’m excited to see what’s next and to keep building on the momentum I’ve gained so far. Whether it’s through vlogging, learning, or interviewing, I’m determined to keep moving forward in my journey as a self-taught developer. </p>
                <p>Thank for listening!</p>

                <h2>My First Blog Post: A New Adventure Begins</h2>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 16px">By: Chris (BytesByBlinken)</p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;" >Published on: <time datetime="12-15-2024">December 15, 2024</time></p>
                <p>This is my very first blog post, and I couldn’t be more excited to start this journey of sharing my experiences. 
                    My name is Chris, and after years of doing things that didn’t fully satisfy me, I’ve decided to make a major change in my career. 
                    I’m diving into the world of coding and web development, learning languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even C#. 
                    While it hasn’t always been easy, it’s been a thrilling adventure that has pushed me out of my comfort zone.</p>
                <p>Learning to code later in life wasn’t something I expected to do, but sometimes life takes you down unexpected paths. 
                    After realizing that I wanted more flexibility and growth opportunities, I decided to invest in myself and make this change. 
                    The beauty of coding is that it’s a lifelong learning process. Every new project, every new concept, and every bug I fix reminds 
                    me that it’s never too late to learn something new and pursue a career that excites me.</p>
                <p>What keeps me going on this new adventure is the thrill of progress. Every time I master a new concept or build something from scratch,
                     I feel like I’m one step closer to my goal. But it’s not just about the end result—it’s about the journey. 
                     There’s a sense of satisfaction in knowing I’m learning and growing, even if it’s challenging at times. 
                     My family and my desire to provide a better future for them also play a huge role in motivating me to push through tough days. 
                     It’s all worth it in the end, and I’m looking forward to seeing where this journey will take me.</p>
                <p>Thank for listening!</p>
